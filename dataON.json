So, the best way for you is to act according to her command and you will get through itAmanda the Adventurer Secret Ending Once you complete the three episodes in the game, you will find out that there is something weird about everything that is going on. Though the developers have said they are looking into a sequel of the title, but that is still not enough for those who have had the experience. So, most of the gamers are asking if there is a secret ending to the overall adventure? Well, there are many theories and from the gameplay itself, it seems like there is an uncanny final order from the little adventurer who is without her companion ‘Wooly’ in the last setting. She asks you to knock at a door and is followed by a decree which says, “Let me in!”. Well, to unsettle you from your seat, she is at your door and asking you to open the door for her. Remember in the beginning where Wooly wanted to warn you but was suddenly interrupted?.",

This is about a little brave girl named Amanda and her only companion which is a sheep named Wooly. You find them on your attic in a box set of a TV Show from long ago. You cannot recall what particular show it is or who were the characters or even what exactly happens here. Despite all this strangeness, you have a familiar feeling and want to explore anyway. The title is created for DreadXP Found Footage Jam. A short horror story where you will be watching all the unfolding horror on a VHS tape. These VHS videotapes are found by you in your attic and it is time for you to explore them. As soon as you put them in the VCR player, you will find out that this is related to a kid’s TV show. The similarities of this show could be matched with the ’90s TV programs that were created for educational purposes.",
