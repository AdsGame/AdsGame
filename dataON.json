Ideally, here you can even create your own mini-movie, performing one action after another and putting them in a loop. The game engine is very flexible. It allows you to realize any fantasy. Initially, we need to choose a map. Many of them are suitable for your purpose at first. When you not just play, but set clear goals for yourself, choice of location can play an important role.
